# knowledge-server

A persistent memory layer for AI coding agents. Reads your session history, extracts what's worth keeping, and injects relevant entries into new conversations automatically.

Works with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) (GitHub Copilot). Fully local — no external service required beyond an LLM API key you already have.

**In practice:** if you spent a session working out how your auth system works, the next time you ask an auth-related question in a new session, the relevant conclusions from that previous session are silently included as context before the LLM sees your message. The agent has access to what was established before, without you having to re-explain it.

It doesn't always work. The extraction quality depends on your LLM and what was said. Most sessions produce nothing — the bar is intentionally high. But when it does work, it removes a real friction point.

## Install

Supports **Linux x64** and **macOS arm64** (Apple Silicon). No Bun or Node.js required.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MAnders333/knowledge-server/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**After running:**

1. Edit `~/.config/knowledge-server/.env` — set your LLM API key (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`)
2. Register with your tool(s):
   ```bash
   knowledge-server setup-tool opencode     # OpenCode
   knowledge-server setup-tool claude-code  # Claude Code
   knowledge-server setup-tool cursor       # Cursor
   knowledge-server setup-tool codex        # Codex CLI
   knowledge-server setup-tool vscode       # VSCode / GitHub Copilot
   ```
3. Start the server: `knowledge-server`

That's it. The server auto-starts the episode collector alongside itself — nothing else to configure for single-machine use.

**To update:**

```bash
knowledge-server update
```

### From source

**Prerequisites:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.2

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAnders333/knowledge-server
cd knowledge-server
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env — set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY
bun run setup   # installs deps, registers OpenCode MCP server
bun run start   # starts both server and daemon
```

For other tools, run the corresponding setup command after `bun run start`:

```bash
bun run start setup-tool claude-code  # Claude Code
bun run start setup-tool cursor       # Cursor
bun run start setup-tool codex        # Codex CLI
bun run start setup-tool vscode       # VSCode
```

All setup steps are idempotent — re-running is safe.

## How it works

Once running, three things happen automatically and passively:

1. **Episode collection** — `knowledge-daemon` (started alongside the server) reads your AI tool session files in the background and uploads new conversations to a staging table.
2. **Consolidation** — every 8 hours, the server reads staged conversations and asks an LLM: *what from this session is worth remembering long-term?* Most sessions produce nothing. High bar.
3. **Activation** — on every new message, the query is embedded and matched against stored entries. Only semantically relevant entries activate, injected silently as context before the LLM sees your message.

There is no manual step. Knowledge accumulates in the background.

## Design

The core problem with agent memory is that naive approaches store everything and retrieve too much. Context windows fill with loosely-related facts, and the store grows without bound.

The design is loosely inspired by how human memory consolidates experience. Three properties follow from this:

**High extraction bar.** The LLM reads session transcripts and asks whether each thing learned would still be useful months from now. Most sessions produce nothing. The store only grows when something genuinely new was established — a confirmed fact, a decision made, a procedure that worked.

**Reconsolidation instead of accumulation.** Before a new entry is inserted, it's embedded and compared to the nearest existing entry. If similarity ≥ 0.82, a focused LLM call decides whether to keep, update, replace, or insert both. Entries in the 0.4–0.82 band (related but not near-duplicate) get a contradiction scan: if two entries make mutually exclusive claims, the system resolves it. The store updates rather than appends.

**Cue-dependent activation.** Nothing is retrieved proactively. When a new message arrives, its text is embedded and matched against all stored entries. Only semantically similar entries activate. The query is the retrieval cue — entries that have no bearing on the current conversation stay silent.

Entries have a strength score that decays with time and inactivity, and increases with repeated access. Entries that fall below the archive threshold are eventually removed. There is no manual pruning.

```

The daemon and server share the same database. In single-machine setups this is a local SQLite file. In team setups, both point at a shared Postgres instance.

## Supported session sources

| Source | What is read | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenCode** | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite) | macOS, Linux |
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (JSONL conversation logs) | macOS, Linux |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` (JSONL rollout logs) | macOS, Linux |
| **Cursor** | `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (SQLite) | macOS |
| **Cursor** | `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` (SQLite) | Linux |
| **VSCode** | `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/*/chatSessions/*.json` | macOS |
| **VSCode** | `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/*/chatSessions/*.json` | Linux |
| **Local files** | `~/knowledge/*.md` (Markdown) | macOS, Linux |

All sources are auto-detected. Disable any with `OPENCODE_ENABLED=false`, etc. Override a path with `OPENCODE_DB_PATH`, etc.

The local-files source is opt-in by directory presence: if `~/knowledge/` does not exist it is silently skipped.

## Components

### knowledge-daemon (`src/daemon/`)

A lightweight background process (~250 KB binary) that reads local session files and uploads new episodes to the `pending_episodes` staging table. Keeps its own upload cursor in local SQLite (`daemon_cursor`), independent from consolidation progress.

**Started automatically** alongside the server for single-machine setups (set `DAEMON_AUTO_SPAWN=false` to opt out). For multi-machine or remote setups, run it separately:

```bash
knowledge-daemon --interval=300     # poll every 5 minutes
knowledge-server setup-tool daemon  # or register as a system service (launchd / systemd)
```

### knowledge-server (`src/index.ts`)

The main HTTP server. Drains `pending_episodes` via the consolidation engine, exposes knowledge via `/activate` and MCP, and serves the HTTP API.

### HTTP API (`src/api/server.ts`)

Hono-based HTTP server. Binds to `127.0.0.1:3179` by default.

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/activate?q=...` | GET | — | Activate knowledge entries by query |
| `/consolidate` | POST | admin | Run a consolidation batch |
| `/reinitialize?confirm=yes` | POST | admin | Wipe all entries and reset state |
| `/status` | GET | — (config requires admin) | Health check and stats |
| `/entries` | GET | — | List entries (filter by `status`, `type`, `scope`) |
| `/entries/:id` | GET | — | Get a specific entry with relations |
| `/entries/:id` | PATCH | admin | Update content, topics, confidence, status, scope |
| `/entries/:id/resolve` | POST | admin | Resolve a conflicted entry pair |
| `/entries/:id` | DELETE | admin | Hard-delete an entry |
| `/review` | GET | — | Surface conflicted, stale, and team-relevant entries |
| `/hooks/claude-code/user-prompt` | POST | — | Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook endpoint |
| `/mcp` | ALL | — / admin | MCP streamable-http endpoint |

### MCP server

Exposes a single tool: `activate`. Agents use this for deliberate recall mid-task.

Two connection modes:

**stdio** — `knowledge-server mcp` starts a lightweight stdio proxy. Registered automatically by `setup-tool`. Only `KNOWLEDGE_HOST`/`KNOWLEDGE_PORT` needed; no LLM credentials required.

**streamable-http** — `ALL /mcp` on the main HTTP server. MCP clients connect directly at `http://127.0.0.1:3179/mcp`. When `KNOWLEDGE_ADMIN_TOKEN` is set, requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — suitable for hosted setups.

### Consolidation engine (`src/consolidation/`)

- `readers/pending.ts` — drains `pending_episodes` uploaded by the daemon
- `consolidate.ts` — full cycle: read → extract → reconsolidate → contradiction scan → decay → embed → synthesis → delete processed rows
- `llm.ts` — four LLM calls: `extractKnowledge` (extraction model), `decideMerge` (merge model), `detectAndResolveContradiction` (contradiction model), `synthesizePrinciple` (synthesis model, fires rarely on ripe clusters)
- `decay.ts` — forgetting curve with type-specific half-lives

## Configuration

Configuration is split across two files:

**`~/.config/knowledge-server/.env`** — credentials and tuning parameters (API keys, model names, thresholds). Loaded by the launcher wrapper at startup.

**`~/.config/knowledge-server/config.jsonc`** — store topology (which databases to use and where). Created automatically on first run (default: local SQLite). Edit this for Postgres or multi-store setups.

### Store configuration (`config.jsonc`)

The default `config.jsonc` uses a single local SQLite store — no editing needed for single-machine use.

For Postgres, a non-default port, or to disable daemon auto-spawn, edit `~/.config/knowledge-server/config.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  // Store config (required)
  "stores": [
    {
      "id": "main",
      "kind": "postgres",
      "uri": "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/knowledge",
      "writable": true
    }
  ],

  // Deployment settings (optional — defaults shown)
  "port": 3179,
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "daemonAutoSpawn": true,   // set false if you manage the daemon separately

  // Multi-user identity (optional)
  // "userId": "your-name"
}
```

Secrets (Postgres URIs, API keys) can also be kept out of the config file using env vars:
```bash
# Instead of "uri" in config.jsonc:
export STORE_MAIN_URI="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/knowledge"
```
Env vars take precedence over the config file for all fields.

**Migrating from v2:** If you had `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URI`, `KNOWLEDGE_DB_PATH`, `KNOWLEDGE_PORT`, or `KNOWLEDGE_HOST` set, run once to generate `config.jsonc` from them:
```bash
knowledge-server migrate-config
```

### LLM credentials (`.env`)

**Option A — Direct API key (most common):**

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # Anthropic models
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # OpenAI models + embeddings
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...             # Google models
```

**Option B — Unified proxy (OpenRouter, LiteLLM, etc.):**

```bash
LLM_API_KEY=your-key
LLM_BASE_ENDPOINT=https://your-proxy.example.com
```

Provider-specific credentials take precedence over the unified endpoint.

### LLM models

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_EXTRACTION_MODEL` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | Episode → knowledge extraction |
| `LLM_MERGE_MODEL` | `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` | Near-duplicate merge decisions (cheaper) |
| `LLM_CONTRADICTION_MODEL` | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` | Contradiction detection and resolution |

### Embeddings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `text-embedding-3-large` | Embedding model. **Changing this re-embeds all entries on next startup.** |
| `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` | *(model default)* | Truncated output dimensions (only valid for `text-embedding-3-*`) |
| `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | *(see below)* | Dedicated embedding endpoint. Priority: `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` → `OPENAI_BASE_URL` → `LLM_BASE_ENDPOINT/openai/v1` |
| `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | *(see below)* | Falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY` then `LLM_API_KEY` |

For local embeddings via Ollama:
```bash
EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
```

### Server

`port`, `host`, and `daemonAutoSpawn` are deployment settings — set them in `config.jsonc` (see above) or override at runtime with an env var.

## Usage

### Start the server

```bash
knowledge-server        # binary install
bun run start           # source install
```

The daemon starts automatically. The server runs background consolidation on startup if pending sessions exist, then polls every 8 hours.

### Stop the server

```bash
knowledge-server stop
```

### Check status

```bash
knowledge-server status
```

Shows whether the server is running, entry counts, last consolidation time, and pending sessions.

### Trigger consolidation manually

```bash
knowledge-server consolidate                         # CLI (no server needed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://127.0.0.1:3179/consolidate                 # HTTP API
```

### Test knowledge activation

```bash
knowledge-server activate "how do we handle authentication"
```

Shows which entries would be injected for a given query, with similarity scores.

### Calibrate similarity thresholds

```bash
knowledge-server calibrate
```

Derives recommended threshold values for your embedding model. Run this when switching models.

### Review knowledge entries

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3179/review
```

Returns conflicted, stale, and team-relevant entries. OpenCode and Claude Code users also have a `/knowledge-review` slash command (installed by `setup-tool`).

### Reinitialize the knowledge store

```bash
knowledge-server reinitialize --confirm   # wipe all entries
```

## Multi-machine / team setup

For a team where multiple developers want to share a knowledge base, or where the consolidation server runs on a separate machine (e.g. a home server):

**Each local machine:**
1. Install `knowledge-daemon` only (or full install with `DAEMON_AUTO_SPAWN=false` on the remote server)
2. Point `config.jsonc` at the shared Postgres:
   ```jsonc
   { "stores": [{ "id": "main", "kind": "postgres", "uri": "postgres://...", "writable": true }] }
   ```
3. Run the daemon: `knowledge-daemon` or `knowledge-server setup-tool daemon`

**Remote server:**
1. Install `knowledge-server`
2. Point `config.jsonc` at the same Postgres
3. Set `DAEMON_AUTO_SPAWN=false`
4. Start: `knowledge-server`

The daemon uploads episodes directly to Postgres. The server consolidates from there. All machines' knowledge accumulates in one place.

## Knowledge entry types

| Type | Description | Approximate half-life |
|---|---|---|
| `fact` | A confirmed factual statement | ~30 days |
| `pattern` | A recurring pattern or observation | ~90 days |
| `decision` | A decision made and its rationale | ~120 days |
| `principle` | A guiding principle or preference | ~180 days |
| `procedure` | A step-by-step process or workflow | ~365 days |

## Security

**Admin token** — Mutation endpoints require an admin token. A random token is generated at startup and printed to stdout. Set `KNOWLEDGE_ADMIN_TOKEN` in `.env` (≥16 chars) for a stable token across restarts.

**Localhost only** — The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and refuses to start if `KNOWLEDGE_HOST` is set to a non-loopback address. No TLS — not designed for network exposure.

**Prompt injection** — Session content is sent to an LLM for extraction. Adversarial text in your sessions (code you pasted, web content you discussed) could influence what gets consolidated. The extraction prompt is hardened, and any injected entry must still pass similarity checks. The extraction bar (most sessions → nothing) significantly limits attack surface.

**Binary integrity** — Binaries are SHA-256 verified before install. The installer decompresses and verifies before moving files into place. `knowledge-server update` does the same.
