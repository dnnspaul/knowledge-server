/**
 * Compute the current strength of a knowledge entry.
 *
 * Models the human forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus), with bonuses that extend
 * the effective half-life rather than multiply a compounding product.
 *
 * Formula:
 *   effectiveHalfLife = baseHalfLife × observationBonus × accessBonus
 *   decayFactor = e^(-ln2 × daysSinceLastAccess / effectiveHalfLife)
 *   strength = confidence × decayFactor   (clamped to [0, 1])
 *
 * Bonuses (both use the same log2 shape for diminishing returns):
 *   observationBonus = 1 + log2(1 + observationCount)
 *     — evidence signal: how many episodes produced this knowledge
 *     — observationCount starts at 1 (insertion itself is the first observation),
 *       so the minimum bonus is 2× — every new entry gets a baseline durability boost
 *     — observationCount=1 (new entry): bonus = 1 + log2(2) = 2×
 *     — observationCount=3: bonus = 1 + log2(4) = 3×
 *     — observationCount=7: bonus = 1 + log2(8) = 4×
 *   accessBonus = 1 + log2(1 + accessCount)
 *     — retrieval signal: how many times this was surfaced during activation
 *     — accessCount starts at 0, so the minimum bonus is 1× (no retrieval boost yet)
 *
 * `confidence` is the LLM's extraction-time quality estimate (prior).
 * It is a ceiling, never mutated after insertion.
 *
 * Examples (fact type, baseHalfLife = 30 days):
 *   New entry, never accessed (obs=1, access=0):
 *     observationBonus = 1 + log2(2) = 2,  accessBonus = 1 + log2(1) = 1
 *     effectiveHalfLife = 30 × 2 × 1 = 60 days
 *   4 observations, never accessed (obs=4, access=0):
 *     observationBonus = 1 + log2(5) ≈ 3.32,  accessBonus = 1
 *     effectiveHalfLife = 30 × 3.32 × 1 ≈ 100 days
 *   4 obs + 4 accesses (obs=4, access=4):
 *     both bonuses ≈ 3.32
 *     effectiveHalfLife = 30 × 3.32 × 3.32 ≈ 331 days
