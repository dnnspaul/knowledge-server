	/**
	 * KB-wide cluster-first cross-session synthesis pass.
	 *
	 * Called once per consolidation cycle, AFTER ensureEmbeddings() so all entries
	 * have embeddings.
	 *
	 * Algorithm:
	 * 1. CLUSTER FORMATION (in-memory, O(n×k)):
	 *    - Sort all active entries by observationCount desc (most-evidenced entries seed clusters first).
	 *    - Greedy assign each entry to nearest existing cluster if centroid similarity
	 *      ≥ CLUSTER_ASSIGNMENT_THRESHOLD (env: CLUSTER_ASSIGNMENT_THRESHOLD), else start a new cluster.
	 *    - Update centroid as running average after each assignment.
	 *
	 * 2. CLUSTER IDENTITY RECONCILIATION (against DB):
	 *    - Match each in-memory cluster to persisted cluster by centroid similarity
	 *      ≥ CLUSTER_IDENTITY_THRESHOLD (0.9) → reuse ID.
	 *    - No match → new cluster ID.
	 *    - Persisted clusters with no match → deleted (entries dispersed).
	 *
	 * 3. RIPENESS CHECK:
	 *    - last_membership_changed_at > last_synthesized_at OR last_synthesized_at IS NULL.
	 *    - Minimum CLUSTER_MIN_MEMBERS (env: CLUSTER_MIN_MEMBERS) members.
	 *
	 * 4. SYNTHESIS (per ripe cluster):
	 *    - All members are peers (no anchor/neighbor distinction).
	 *    - LLM returns array of zero or more principles.
	 *    - Each result routed through reconsolidate() for deduplication.
	 *    - Write last_synthesized_at on cluster after successful synthesis attempt.
	 *
	 * Returns the number of synthesis calls that produced at least one principle.
	 *
	 * Domain routing: when domains are configured each store's knowledge is
	 * synthesised independently. Pass the target store explicitly — the caller
	 * is responsible for iterating over each store that received writes this run.
	 * Defaults to this.db for single-store / backwards-compatible callers.
