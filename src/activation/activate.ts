/**
 * Split a prompt into activation cues for multi-topic retrieval.
 *
 * Strategy (mirrors the OpenCode plugin):
 *   1. Per-line segments — each newline is a topic boundary (Shift+Enter in most UIs).
 *      Segments shorter than MIN_CUE_CHARS are skipped (greetings, "yes", "ok", etc.)
 *   2. The full trimmed prompt as a holistic cue — captures overall intent that no
 *      individual line may fully express.
 *   3. Deduplication — if the message is a single line, the segment and the full
 *      message are the same string; the Set removes the duplicate.
 *
 * All resulting cues are embedded in a single batched API call downstream.
 *
 * Exported so server.ts (claude-code hook) can reuse the same logic without
 * duplicating it. The plugin (plugin/knowledge.ts) runs as a standalone file
 * and must keep its own copy — kept in sync via tests/format.test.ts parity tests.
