/**
 * SQLite schema for the knowledge graph.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Embeddings stored as BLOB (raw float32 arrays) for efficient cosine similarity
 * - Timestamps in unix milliseconds (consistent with OpenCode)
 * - Topics stored as JSON array (queryable via json_each)
 * - Derived-from stored as JSON array of session/entry IDs (provenance chain)
 *
 * v5: Added observation_count — evidence signal (how many episodes produced this
 * knowledge), kept separate from access_count (retrieval signal). Removed all
 * migration code — single clean schema, DB is reinitialized on upgrade.
 *
 * v6: Multi-source support.
 * - consolidated_episode gains a `source` column (e.g. "opencode", "claude-code")
 *   and a new composite PK (source, session_id, start_message_id, end_message_id).
 * - New source_cursor table replaces the per-source cursor previously embedded in
 *   consolidation_state. Keyed by source; stores the per-source high-water mark
 *   (last_message_time_created) and the last time that source was consolidated.
 * - consolidation_state retains the global counters and lastConsolidatedAt but
 *   last_message_time_created is removed (superseded by source_cursor).
 *
 * v7: Cross-session synthesis (per-entry trigger).
 * - knowledge_entry gains `last_synthesized_observation_count` (INTEGER, NULL).
 *   MIGRATION: v6 → v7 is incremental (ALTER TABLE, no data loss).
 *
 * v8: Embedding metadata.
 * - New embedding_metadata singleton table stores the model name and dimension
 *   count used to produce the current embeddings. On startup, the server compares
 *   the stored model against the configured EMBEDDING_MODEL — if they differ, all
 *   entry embeddings are regenerated automatically (re-embed) so cosine similarity
 *   remains valid across model changes.
 *   MIGRATION: v7 → v8 is incremental (CREATE TABLE, no data loss).
 *
 * v9: Cluster-first synthesis.
 * - Replaces per-entry synthesis trigger (observation_count threshold) with
 *   persistent cluster tables. Each consolidation run greedily clusters active
 *   entries by embedding similarity, matches clusters to persisted rows by centroid
 *   similarity, and synthesizes any cluster whose membership changed since last
 *   synthesis (last_membership_changed_at > last_synthesized_at).
 * - New tables: knowledge_cluster, knowledge_cluster_member.
 * - knowledge_entry loses `last_synthesized_observation_count` (no longer needed).
 * - MIGRATION: v8 → v9 is incremental: DROP COLUMN on knowledge_entry, CREATE TABLE
 *   for both cluster tables. No knowledge data is lost.
 *
 * v10: is_synthesized column.
 * - knowledge_entry gains `is_synthesized INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`.
 *   Replaces the fragile source.startsWith('synthesis:') convention with an
 *   authoritative persistent flag. Existing synthesis entries are backfilled.
 * - MIGRATION: v9 → v10 is incremental: ALTER TABLE + UPDATE backfill. No data loss.
 *
 * v11: Multi-user cursor support.
 * - source_cursor gains a `user_id` column and a new composite PK (source, user_id).
 *   Each user running against a shared DB advances their own cursor independently.
 * - consolidated_episode gains a `user_id` column and is added to the PK.
 *   Prevents one user's processed episodes from blocking another user's consolidation.
 * - user_id defaults to 'default' for backwards-compatible single-user mode.
 *   In multi-user setups, set user_id via the KNOWLEDGE_USER_ID env var or config.jsonc.
 * - MIGRATION: v10 → v11 is incremental: ALTER TABLE + PK rebuild via drop+recreate.
 *
 * v12: Episode uploader daemon support.
 * - pending_episodes: staging table where the daemon writes raw episodes before
 *   the server consolidates them. Decouples episode reading (done on the user's
 *   machine by the daemon) from consolidation (done on the server). Enables
 *   cross-device and multi-user setups where the server can't read local files.
 * - daemon_cursor: per-source high-water mark for the daemon.
 * - MIGRATION: v11 → v12 is additive: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS — no data loss.
 *
 * v13: Daemon-only consolidation — remove direct file reader infrastructure.
 * - source_cursor table removed: was the high-water mark for direct file readers.
 *   With daemon-only consolidation, pending_episodes is self-draining (rows deleted
 *   after consolidation) and consolidated_episode provides idempotency — no cursor needed.
 * - user_id removed from consolidated_episode: consolidation drains all pending episodes
 *   regardless of origin; user_id on pending_episodes and consolidated_episode is now
 *   provenance metadata only, not a routing or filtering key.
 * - MIGRATION: v12 → v13 drops source_cursor and rebuilds consolidated_episode without
 *   user_id. Knowledge data is not affected.
